This live project is a data-driven investigation into how Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors create cascading "ripple effects" across the Indian business landscape. In an era where sustainability is no longer optional, this initiative moves beyond simple compliance to quantitatively analyze the profound and often hidden impacts of ESG performance.

Our core mission is to map and measure the transmission of ESG signals through the economy. We are building a dynamic analytical platform that tracks how a single ESG event—such as a major company's poor governance score, a supply chain carbon scandal, or a landmark regulatory shift like the BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting) mandate—can propagate and reshape market dynamics.

Key Analytical Focus Areas:

Valuation Ripples: Quantifying the link between ESG performance (and controversies) and key financial metrics like stock price volatility, cost of capital, and market valuation.

Supply Chain Contagion: Analyzing how the ESG (un)sustainability of a leading firm impacts its suppliers, partners, and competitors within the same sector.

Regulatory and Strategic Impact: Assessing how policy changes (like BRSR) influence corporate disclosure quality, strategic decision-making, and competitive positioning.

By integrating real-world data from authoritative sources—including BRSR reports, ICRA Analytics' EQ360, and financial databases like CMIE Prowess—this project employs rigorous methodologies like event studies and regression analysis. It is further enriched by in-depth case studies of Indian companies navigating the ESG transformation, from facing crises to pioneering sustainable practices.

The ultimate goal is to move ESG from a static, checkbox report to a dynamic, understandable force. We aim to provide actionable insights for investors, policymakers, and business leaders, demonstrating that in modern India, ESG isn't just a responsibility—it's a fundamental driver of long-term value and systemic risk.
